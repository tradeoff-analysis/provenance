Maybe, there is something amazing here [points to different part of SPLOM] and I have been ignoring it. B:Yeah but it's also a matter of priorities right?

Là, (exploration passé) on se disait l'arrome doit etre environ entre ça et ça. {...} l'idee c'est la même. tout à l'heure (exploration du present) on a tracé une ligne sur laquelle on a alligné 3 points. là [exploration du passé] on a tracé une zone sur laquelle on a alligné des points.","Yes, here instead of selecting 73 points for the green selection [...] as we did in the past exploration we just selected 3 or 4 points, it's the same idea in today's exploration we drew a line on which we aligned points [...]"

25,5_4_opportunities,5.4.1 Recall Opportunities >> Recall: Focus & priority,CS-eco,19,00:59:34,,"This is very difficult... It means that they are categorical values ... For example, if I click on it there are a lot of points overlap. So for example here, there are many points overlapped and it's very difficult... This is something diffucult to explore with a scatter plot"

30,5_4_opportunities,5.4.1 Recall Opportunities >> Recall: Data semantics & origin : Dimension,CS-eco,5,00:34:47,,"Okay. So I, I just need to remember the indicators that we have.

38,5_4_opportunities,5.4.3 Meta-Analysis Opportunities,CS-w,124,00:23:39,C’est vrai qu’on avait une démarche pour la sélection des points en 2 ou 3 étapes successives pour sélectionner les zones et recentrer sur quelques recettes,"It is true that we had an approach where we previously had 3 or 4 consecutive steps to select them, and focused on a few recipes"
39,5_4_opportunities,5.4.3 Meta-Analysis Opportunities,CS-eco,15,00:55:21,,"I kind of feel that sometimes I explore data, but I don't really..., it's very easy to forget what they do because sometimes I just follow my intuition, I just explore, and immediately after, I don't remember why I was doing that in this exercise on the exploration. Because, for example, I remember very clearly about the case study because in my mind I register that a case study is important. And in fact, I did the some further analysis in that, but, the previous exploration, I'm sure I have the criteria on the moment that I was exploring, but I it's very easy to forget that. I see, because now, now I really, I really don't remember what I was exploring. So I think it's very nice to have something that helps me."
40,5_4_opportunities,5.4.3 Meta-Analysis Opportunities,CS-eco,40,01:41:20,,"Probably there is a reason if I explored more those squares, so given that I don't remember at all what we did last time. This was a very good suggestion for continuing the exploration."
41,5_4_opportunities,5.4.4 Presentation & Collaboration Opportunities,CS-ml,108,01:32:50,,"A: It could be useful to take notes in this … maybe also directly on the figure, the view you're seeing on the screen. Because then if you take notes on paper, then you have to match, months later, what you have written to what you have seen, so it could be painful. But if you can take notes directly on the plot and save the screen, the plot as a favourite with the notes… then it's much easier. Certainly in some cases, applications that could be critical. B: I actually was thinking the same thing but it looks interesting on paper, I'm not sure that people would actually use it. Well, because of course, intuitively you say, Oh, of course I save a favourite with a note telling me what was relevant in the view. But for example, we also have the opportunity of changing the names of the selections.  A: And we did that. B: I think it's super useful, but personally, okay. I am a little bit methodical when I use, for example, Photoshop. I name every layer. I give a name to every layer because I need to remember which layer is, which, but I think sometimes, like in most cases, people don't do it. So, on the surface, I will say it looks really appealing to say, okay, I saved this view and then I write a few notes. But, yeah, I don't know if it's…(useful). If it requires a lot of effort, I am not sure it's worth it"
42,5_4_opportunities,5.4.4 Presentation & Collaboration Opportunities,CS-w,167,01:12:05,"on a écrit sur la tableau, critère1 c’est ça, critère2 c’est ça etc. Le plan d’attaque on le prépare un minimum. On ne se dit pas, tiens peut être on va essayer un scenario","[Last session] we wrote on the board, we wrote criteria 1 is, criteria 2 is, The main plan is prepared at a minimum. We don't say to each other, let's just try a scenario"
